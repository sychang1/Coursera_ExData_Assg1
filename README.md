# README.md  

This repository contains the following files. 
They correspond to the assignment 1 of Coursera's Exploratory Data Analysis Course.

0. README.md              : Current document.
1. plot0.R                : R script that reads in the raw data. It must be executed just once before all the other scripts.
2. plot1.R ~ plot4.R      : R scripts that draw the figures.
3. plot1.png ~ plot4.png  : Figure files produced by the scripts.

IMPORTANT: The raw data is quite large and it takes some time to read. Thus, there is a separate script "plot0.R" to read the raw data just once.
